*KewBridge* is an effort to prioritise, build and document datasets which can be used to train machine learning applications. 

Scoping and prioritising this work is likely to involve quite a bit of discussion: we will try to do this in the open using the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/KewBridge/discussions) feature.
